# Encryption Program

## Overview
This is a simple C++ encryption program designed to encode text using a custom algorithm. The program does not rely on external libraries or graphical interfaces, making it lightweight and easy to understand. All input and output occur through the terminal.

## Features
- Encrypts plain text using a basic substitution or shift-based algorithm.
- Implements the encryption logic without using any external libraries.
- Designed to be simple and educational.

## Requirements
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- A terminal or command prompt to run the program

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the source code file.
2. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. Common compilers include:
   - GCC: [gcc.gnu.org](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
   - Clang: [clang.llvm.org](https://clang.llvm.org/)
3. Compile the program using your preferred compiler.

## Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code.
3. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   g++ prograName.cpp
   ```
4. Run the program using:
   ```bash
   ./a.out
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt text.


## Notes
- Input validation and edge cases (e.g., non-alphabetic characters) are handled in the logic.
